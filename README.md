# Find Me Books

This week, you’ll take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

* I WANT to search for new books to read
* SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

* GIVEN a book search engine

* WHEN I load the search engine
* THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
* WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
* THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button
* WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
* THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
* WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
* THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
* WHEN the toggle is set to Signup
* THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button
* WHEN the toggle is set to Login
* THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button
* WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
